# weather-dashboard

## HTML
First I started off using bootstrap to style my page and to add content

## API KEY
I generated my own API Key from Open Weather

## AJAX
And then I went ahead and linked my scripts to open weather database using ajax
* I also started with some javascript events such as creating a button that pulls the city name

* Humidity
* Wind Speend
